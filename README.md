#Neoclassical Model

In this project we develop a Neoclassical model using the library Dynare in MATLAB. This is based on a test taken in my Master's degree about macroeconomic fluctuations.

In the Document Modelo Neoclasico.pdf you will find all the details (in Spanish) on how the model is solve numerically speaking.
